<p style='text-align: justify;'>Difficulty with sensory processing is commonly observed in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which can
affect their ability to react appropriately to sensory stimuli. Individuals with ASD also have unique patterns of sensory
processing to sense the environment. We collected 21 ASD children’s sensory processing patterns using Dunn’s Sensory
Profile. The impact of these sensory profiles combined with environmental factors was assessed, particularly on behaviour
and attention. Each child completed 15 experiment sessions of attentional tasks within two months, while a prototype
application was deployed to collect physiological and environmental data. The machine learning-based analysis identified
that noise, temperature, humidity, and sensory profile affected children’s attention significantly and differently. The
performance of the machine learning models shows the feasibility of predicting the behaviour and attention with data
collected by the prototype, which provides significant implications for subsequent development of a predictive sensory
management application for ASD people. </p>
